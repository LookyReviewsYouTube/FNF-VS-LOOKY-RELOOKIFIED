# 🌟 FRIDAY NIGHT FUNKIN' VS LOOKY - RELOOKIFIED

> Note from Developer:

THIS MOD IS A PASSION PROJECT!!! This mod was made for friends and I kinda didn't expect it to get it where it is right now... 

Please remember that Version 9 will be in development some time soon with a whole engine recode!

The OG Mod:
The Mod was originally made on the 26th June 2023 as a One shot mod using the song Spunchbob as a cover made by Kodo and sprites also made by Kodo.

After that I started working on FNF VS Looky being an actual mod having more songs and stuff.
